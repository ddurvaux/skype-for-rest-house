A solution to Skype your grandma/ grandpa in their rest house under confinment

Note: this will be filled in ;).

## Background
With the COVID crisis it could be hard to meet your relatives and if they are not familiar with some video-conferencing technologies, it could be very hard for them not to stay isolated.

This small project build a solution which require zero interaction for them to be able to receive a Skype call.  It only relies on Microsoft Skype, a Linux (ubuntu) box and some configuration.
